== MediaWiki 1.34.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.34 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.34 ==
1.34 has several database changes since 1.33, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.34 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.33.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.34 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgAllowExternalReqID (T201409) - This configuration setting controls whether
  Mediawiki accepts the request ID set by the incoming request via the
  `X-Request-Id` header. If set to `true`, that value will be used throughout
  the code as the request identificator. Otherwise, the sent header will be
  ignored and the request ID will either be taken from Apache's mod_unique
  module or will be generated by Mediawiki itself (depending on the set-up).

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgUseCdn, $wgCdnServers, $wgCdnServersNoPurge, and $wgCdnMaxAge – These four
  CDN-related config variables have been renamed from being specific to Squid –
  they were previously $wgUseSquid, $wgSquidServers, $wgSquidServersNoPurge, and
  $wgSquidMaxage respectively. This aligns them with the related existing
  variable $wgCdnMaxageLagged. The previous configuration variable names are
  deprecated, but will be used as the fall back if they are still set.
  Note that wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader has not been renamed, as it is deprecated.
* (T27707) File type checks for image uploads have been relaxed to allow files
  containing some HTML markup in metadata. As a result, the $wgAllowTitlesInSVG
  setting is no longer applied and is now always true. Note that MSIE 7 may
  still be able to misinterpret certain malformed PNG files as HTML.
* Introduced $wgVerifyMimeTypeIE to allow disabling the MSIE 6/7 file type
  detection heuristic on upload, which is more conservative than the checks
  that were changed above.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgWikiDiff2MovedParagraphDetectionCutoff — If you still want a custom change
  size threshold, please specify in php.ini, using the configuration variable
  wikidiff2.moved_paragraph_detection_cutoff.

=== New user-facing features in 1.34 ===
* …

=== New developer features in 1.34 ===
* Language::formatTimePeriod now supports the new 'avoidhours' option to output
  strings like "5 days ago" instead of "5 days 13 hours ago".

=== External library changes in 1.34 ===

==== New external libraries ====
* …

==== Changed external libraries ====
* Updated Mustache from 1.0.0 to v3.0.1.
* Updated OOUI from v0.31.3 to v0.32.1.

* …

==== Removed external libraries ====

* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.34 ===
* (T222529) If a log entry or page revision is recorded in the database with an
  empty username, attempting to display it will log an error and return a "no
  username available" to the user instead of silently displaying nothing or
  invalid links.

=== Action API changes in 1.34 ===
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action=query list=allusers,
  deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.34 ===
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.34 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T152908) Added language support for N'Ko (nqo).

=== Breaking changes in 1.34 ===
* The global functions wfSuppressWarnings and wfRestoreWarnings, deprecated in
  1.26, have been removed. Use Wikimedia\AtEase\AtEase::suppressWarnings() and
  Wikimedia\AtEase\AtEase::restoreWarnings() directly.
* Preferences class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* The following parts of code, deprecated in 1.32, were removed in favor of
  built-in PHP functions:
  * CryptRand class
  * CryptRand service
  * Functions of the MWCryptRand class: singleton(), wasStrong() and generate().
* Language::setCode, deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use Language::factory to
  create a new Language object with a different language code.
* MWNamespace::clearCaches() has been removed.  So has the $rebuild parameter
  to MWNamespace::getCanonicalNamespaces(), which was deprecated since 1.31.
  Instead, reset services, such as by calling $this->overrideMwServices() (if
  your test extends MediaWikiTestCase). Services will generally not pick up
  configuration changes from after they were created, so you must reset
  services after any configuration change. Even if your code works now, it is
  likely to break in future versions as more code is moved to services.
* The ill-defined "DatabaseOraclePostInit" hook has been removed.
* PreferencesFormLegacy and PreferencesForm classes, deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.
* ObjectFactory class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* HWLDFWordAccumudlator class, deprecated in 1.28, has been removed.
* XMPInfo, XMPReader and XMPValidate, deprecated in 1.32, have been removed.
* The RedirectSpecialPage::execute method could sometimes return a Title object.
  This behavior was removed, and the method now matches the parent signature
  (SpecialPage::execute) which is to return HTML string or void.
  To obtain the destination title, use RedirectSpecialPage::getRedirect.
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action API action=query
  list=allusers, deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.
* SearchEngine::userNamespaces(), SearchEngine::namespacesAsText(),
  SearchEngine::create(), SearchEngine::getSearchTypes() and
  SearchEngine::getNearMatch(), methods deprecated in 1.27, have been removed.

  removed.
* wfMakeUrlIndexes() function, deprecated in 1.33, have been removed.
* Method signatures in WatchedItemQueryServiceExtension have changed from taking
  User objects to taking UserIdentity objects. Extensions implementing this
  interface need to be changed accordingly.

  removed. Use UserGroupMembership::getGroupPage and ::getLink instead.

  have been removed.

  use OutputPage::showFatalError or throw a FatalError instead. The methods are
  ::showFileCopyError(), ::showFileRenameError(), ::showFileDeleteError(), and
  ::showFileNotFoundError().
* ApiBase::truncateArray(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed.

  INTL_ICU_VERSION constant directly.

  both deprecated in 1.32, have been removed.
* BaseTemplate::msgHtml() and QuickTemplate::msgHtml(), deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed. Use ->msg() or ->getMsg() instead.
* WatchAction::getUnwatchToken(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed. Instead,
  use WatchAction::getWatchToken() with action 'unwatch' directly.
* Language::initEncoding(), ::recodeForEdit(), and recodeInput(), deprecated in
  1.28, have been removed.
* PageArchive::getTextFromRow(), ::listAllPages(), and ::getLastRevisionText(),

=== Deprecations in 1.34 ===
* The MWNamespace class is deprecated. Use NamespaceInfo.
* ExtensionRegistry->load() is deprecated, as it breaks dependency checking.
  Instead, use ->queue().
* User::isBlocked() is deprecated since it does not tell you if the user is
  blocked from editing a particular page. Use User::getBlock() or
  PermissionManager::isBlockedFrom() or PermissionManager::userCan() instead.
* User::isLocallyBlockedProxy and User::inDnsBlacklist are deprecated and moved
  to the BlockManager as private helper methods.
* User::isDnsBlacklisted is deprecated. Use BlockManager::isDnsBlacklisted
  instead.
* The Config argument to ChangesListSpecialPage::checkStructuredFilterUiEnabled
  is deprecated. Pass only the User argument.
* WatchedItem::getUser is deprecated. Use getUserIdentity.

  RevisionStore is deprecated. Omit it, passing only the remaining parameters.

  engine will eventually be made the only engine for HTTP requests.
* RepoGroup::singleton(), RepoGroup::destroySingleton(),
  RepoGroup::setSingleton(), wfFindFile(), and wfLocalFile() are all
  deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices instead.

  Use NamespaceInfo's getSubjectPage, getTalkPage, and getAssociatedPage.
* MWMessagePack class, no longer used, has been deprecated in 1.34.
* The Block class is separated into DatabaseBlock (for blocks stored in the
  database), and SystemBlock (for temporary blocks created by the system).
  SystemBlock should be used when creating any temporary blocks. Block is
  a deprecated alias for DatabaseBlock.
* Parser::$mConf is deprecated. It will be removed entirely in a later version.
  Some context can be found at T224165.
